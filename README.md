# Auth Backend Service

Was built for a frontend application I developed a while back.

Features SMS verification for sending password reset messages.
Hashes credentials and stores them in a db.

Pretty basic, was used to develop an understanding of a barebones auth service than uses a 3rd party service like auth0 / supabase.
